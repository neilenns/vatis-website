# Installation

Download the latest installer from the [vATIS Website](https://vatis.app).

**Windows**<br/>
The setup executable will automatically install vATIS in the `%localappdata%\org.vatsim.vatis` folder and create a desktop shortcut. Due to limitations in the installer wizard, the installation location cannot be changed at this time.

**MacOS**<br/>
Install the vATIS.app in your preferred folder. The recommend location is Applications.

**Linux**<br/>
The client is packaged in AppImage format. You can download and move it to any location of your preference.
