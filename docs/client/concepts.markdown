# Terms & Concepts

Before using vATIS, you should familiarize yourself with few key terms and concepts.

## Profile
A **Profile** acts as a container for managing one or more ATIS Stations.
* Typically, you create a Profile for each controlled facility, such as a TRACON or ARTCC (e.g. one profile for _Las Vegas TRACON_ and another profile for _Los Angeles ARTCC_)

## ATIS Station
An **ATIS Station** represents the configuration for a specific airport, including current conditions and relevant ATIS information.

## Preset
A **Preset** is a predefined set of settings for an ATIS Station, including:
* Airport Conditions
* NOTAMs
* Other ATIS-related configurations

Each ATIS Station can have multiple Presets for different scenarios. For example, you might have a Preset for "WEST OPS" and one for "EAST OPS".
