# Terms & Concepts

Before using vATIS, you should familiarize yourself with few key terms and concepts.

* **Profile**: A Profile serves as a container for one or more ATIS Stations. Typically, you create a Profile for each controlled facility to manage its respective ATIS stations. For instance, you might have one Profile for Las Vegas TRACON and another for the Los Angeles ARTCC.
* **ATIS Station**: Represents the setup for a specific airport, including current conditions and relevant ATIS information.
* **Preset**: A Preset allows you to save predefined Airport Conditions, NOTAMs, and other ATIS settings. Each ATIS Station can have multiple Presets. For example, you might create Presets for various airport configurations such as "WEST OPS" or "EAST OPS."
