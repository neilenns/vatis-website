# Contractions

The Contractions tab allows you to define personalized contractions. If you specify a contraction that already exists in the [Default Contractions](default-contractions) list, your new definition will overwrite it. Contractions serve various purposes, such as creating acronyms or modifying the pronunciation of words when using the text-to-speech engine.

## Adding New Contraction
* To add a new contraction, click the **New** button.
* A dialog will open, prompting you to enter the following details:
    * **Variable**: The name of the contraction variable. If you enter multiple words, it will be automatically converted to variable format (e.g., spaces will be replaced with underscores).
    * **Text**: The written ATIS text that will be displayed.
    * **Voice**: The text that will be spoken by the voice synthesizer.
After filling in the required information, save the contraction to make it available for use in your ATIS messages.
